# Type-Simulator
TypeSimulator is a Python tool designed to simulate human-like typing in text editors. It's useful for demonstrations, tutorials, and testing purposes. The tool uses `pyautogui` to control keyboard inputs, allowing it to type text into virtually any text editor or text input field.
